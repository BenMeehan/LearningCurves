Kubernetes security model includes a number of features that help protect the Kubernetes control plane and the applications running on the cluster from security threats. Some of the key security features in Kubernetes include:

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC allows administrators to define granular permissions for users and applications, controlling what actions they can perform on the Kubernetes API and resources.

2. Network Policies: Kubernetes provides network policies that enable administrators to restrict network access between pods and external endpoints. This helps prevent attackers from accessing sensitive data or resources.

3. Pod Security Policies: Pod Security Policies allow administrators to define security policies that restrict what a pod can do or access on the node where it is scheduled. This helps prevent malicious or unauthorized containers from being deployed on the cluster.

4. Secrets Management: Kubernetes allows administrators to securely store and manage secrets, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates, using the Kubernetes Secrets API. Secrets can be encrypted at rest and only exposed to authorized users or applications.

5. Container Runtime Security: Kubernetes integrates with container runtimes, such as Docker and Containerd, to provide additional security features, such as image verification, resource limits, and seccomp profiles.

6. Admission Controllers: Kubernetes admission controllers enable administrators to enforce policies and security checks on resources before they are created or modified. This helps prevent security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations from being introduced into the cluster.
