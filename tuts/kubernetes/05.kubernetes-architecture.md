Kubernetes architecture is based on a master-worker model, where the master controls the worker nodes and manages the overall state of the cluster. Here are the key components of Kubernetes architecture:

1. Master components: The master components include the API server, etcd, controller manager, and scheduler.
- API server: This is the central control point for the Kubernetes cluster. It provides the REST API that clients use to interact with the cluster.

- etcd: This is a distributed key-value store that is used to store the configuration data for the cluster. It is used by the API server to store information about the state of the cluster.

- Controller manager: This component manages the various controllers that are responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster. It includes the replication controller, endpoint controller, namespace controller, and service account controller.

- Scheduler: This component is responsible for scheduling pods to run on the worker nodes in the cluster.

2. Node components: The node components include the kubelet, kube-proxy, and container runtime.
- Kubelet: This component runs on each node and is responsible for managing the pods and containers on that node. It communicates with the API server to get the desired state for the pods and containers, and then takes actions to ensure that the current state matches the desired state.

- Kube-proxy: This component is responsible for managing network traffic to and from the pods on the node.

- Container runtime: This is the software that runs the containers on the node. Kubernetes supports a variety of container runtimes, including Docker and containerd.

3. Objects: Kubernetes manages the state of the cluster through various objects, including pods, services, deployments, and config maps.
- Pods: A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in the cluster.

- Services: A service provides a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods.

- Deployments: A deployment manages a set of replicas of a pod and provides mechanisms for rolling out updates and scaling the deployment.

- Config maps: A config map is used to store configuration data that can be used by containers in the cluster.
