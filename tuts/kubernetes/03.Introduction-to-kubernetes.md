## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Kubernetes provides a platform for building and deploying distributed applications, making it easier to manage and scale containerized applications. It allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications across a cluster of machines.
