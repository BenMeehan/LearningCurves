Kubernetes provides a powerful toolset to manage application updates and rollbacks seamlessly without downtime. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of updating and rolling back an application in Kubernetes.

### Updating an application
To update an application in Kubernetes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Update the application's container image.
2. Update the application's deployment manifest.
3. Apply the changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

**Step 1: Update the container image**

The first step to updating an application is to build and push a new container image. This image should contain the new version of the application code.

For example, suppose we have an application running in a container with the image `myapp:1.0`. To update the application to version `1.1`, we need to build a new image with the updated code and tag it as `myapp:1.1`.

**Step 2: Update the deployment manifest**

Next, we need to update the deployment manifest to use the new container image. We can achieve this by editing the deployment manifest file and changing the container image tag from `myapp:1.0` to `myapp:1.1`.

For example, here is a simple deployment manifest that deploys the `myapp` container with the image tag `1.0`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

To update the deployment to use the new container image with tag `1.1`, we need to change the `image` field as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Step 3: Apply the changes to the Kubernetes cluster
Once we have updated the container image and deployment manifest, we can apply the changes to the Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f myapp-deployment.yaml
```

This command will apply the updated deployment manifest to the Kubernetes cluster and initiate a rolling update of the application.

During the rolling update, Kubernetes will gradually replace the old containers with the new ones. By default, Kubernetes will replace one container at a time, ensuring that the application remains available during the update.

### Rolling back an application

If an application update fails or causes issues, we can roll back to the previous version using Kubernetes' rollout feature. Here are the steps to roll back an application:

1. Check the rollout history.
2. Roll back to the previous version.

**Step 1: Check the rollout history**

To check the rollout history, we can use the `kubectl rollout history` command:

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp
```

This command will show a list of revisions for the myapp deployment, along with the date and time of the rollout.

Step 2: Roll back to the previous version
To roll back to a specific revision, we can use the `kubectl rollout undo` command:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp --to-revision=2
```

This is wait for the pod with older revision to come up and then terminate the current one so that there is no downtime for your application.
