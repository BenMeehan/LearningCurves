To create Kubernetes objects, 

1. Write a YAML file: Kubernetes objects are typically defined in YAML files that specify the object's metadata, specification, and desired state. You can write these files using a text editor or use a tool like kubectl create to generate them.

2. Apply the YAML file: Once you have written the YAML file, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command. This will create or update the object in the cluster according to the YAML file.

3. Verify the Object: Once the object is created, you can use kubectl to verify that it is running correctly. For example, you can use kubectl get to display information about the object, such as its name, type, and status.

### Creating a deployment

Here is an example YAML file for deploying an NGINX web server on Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This YAML file creates a deployment named `nginx-deployment` with three replicas of an NGINX container. The `selector` field matches pods with the label `app: nginx`. The template field specifies the pod `template`, which includes a container named `nginx` with the `nginx:latest` image and a single port on port 80.

To create this deployment in your Kubernetes cluster, you can save the YAML file to a file called `nginx-deployment.yaml` and apply it using the `kubectl apply` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

This will create the deployment and the associated pods and replica sets. You can verify that the deployment is running correctly using `kubectl get`:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```

This will display information about the deployment, its pods, and its replicas.

### Creating a service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

This creates a service called `my-service` that selects all pods with the label app: `my-app`. The service exposes port 80 and forwards traffic to the pod's port 8080. The service type is set to `LoadBalancer`, which means that the service will get an external IP address (if supported by the underlying infrastructure) and can be accessed from outside the cluster.

You can create this service by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-service.yaml
```

Once the service is created, you can access it using the external IP address assigned to the service (if applicable), or by using the cluster IP assigned to the service. You can also use the service name to access it from within the cluster, as Kubernetes automatically creates a DNS entry for the service.

Services are an important component in Kubernetes, as they provide a stable IP address and DNS name for pods, allowing other pods and services to easily communicate with them.

We will learn more about services in the networking section.
