## Kubernetes 

*also called k8s* :P

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Kubernetes allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It provides a platform for building and deploying distributed applications, making it easier to manage and scale containerized applications.

Kubernetes uses a declarative model for managing applications, which means you define the desired state of the system and Kubernetes takes care of making sure that state is achieved and maintained. This makes it easier to manage complex, distributed systems.

Kubernetes is designed to be portable and extensible, so it can run on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment. It provides a rich set of APIs and extensions that allow you to customize and extend the platform to meet your specific needs.

Some of the key features of Kubernetes include:

- Automatic deployment and scaling of containerized applications
- Automatic recovery from node or application failures
- Horizontal scaling of applications
- Self-healing and auto-placement of containers
- Load balancing and service discovery
- Automatic rollouts and rollbacks of application updates
- Persistent storage management
- Automatic bin packing and resource allocation

Kubernetes has become a popular platform for deploying containerized applications, and it has a large and active community of contributors and users. It provides a powerful and flexible platform for building and deploying distributed applications.
