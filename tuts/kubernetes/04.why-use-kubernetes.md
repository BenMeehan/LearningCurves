## Why use Kubernetes
There are several reasons why one might choose to use Kubernetes for deploying and managing containerized applications:

1. Scalability: Kubernetes is designed to be highly scalable, allowing you to easily scale your applications up or down to meet changing demand.

2. Availability: Kubernetes provides automatic failover and recovery for applications, ensuring that your applications stay available even if individual nodes or containers fail.

3. Portability: Kubernetes is designed to be portable, so you can run your applications on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment without having to make significant changes to your application code.

4. Efficiency: Kubernetes allows you to optimize resource usage by automatically allocating and deallocating resources based on the needs of your applications.

5. Automation: Kubernetes provides a rich set of APIs and tools for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

6. Flexibility: Kubernetes provides a flexible platform for deploying and managing a wide variety of applications, including stateless and stateful applications, batch jobs, and more.

7. Community: Kubernetes has a large and active community of contributors and users, providing a wealth of resources and support for those who use the platform.
