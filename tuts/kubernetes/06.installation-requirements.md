## Kubernetes installation requirements

To install and run Kubernetes, you will need to ensure that your system meets certain hardware and software requirements. Here are some of the key requirements for installing and running Kubernetes:

1. Hardware Requirements:
- At least 2 CPU cores per node (recommended 4 or more)
- At least 2 GB of RAM per node (recommended 8 GB or more)
- Sufficient disk space to store container images and other data.

2. Operating System Requirements:
- Kubernetes can be installed on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. However, Linux is the most commonly used platform for running Kubernetes clusters.

- Supported Linux distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

- The operating system should be up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.

3. Networking Requirements:
- Kubernetes requires a reliable and stable network connection between the master and worker nodes.

- Each node in the cluster should have a unique hostname, IP address, and MAC address.

- It is recommended to use a dedicated network interface for Kubernetes traffic, separate from other network traffic.

4. Container Runtime Requirements:
- Kubernetes supports a variety of container runtimes, including Docker, containerd, and others.

- You will need to install and configure a compatible container runtime on each worker node in the cluster.

5. Additional Requirements:
- Kubernetes requires a compatible version of the Kubernetes API server, etcd, and other components.

- It is recommended to use a tool like kubeadm or a managed Kubernetes service to simplify the installation and configuration process.
