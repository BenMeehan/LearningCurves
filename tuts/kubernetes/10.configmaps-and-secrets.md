Kubernetes provides two ways to manage configuration data for your applications: ConfigMaps and Secrets. ConfigMaps are used to store non-sensitive configuration data, while Secrets are used to store sensitive data such as passwords and API keys.

### ConfigMaps
ConfigMaps allow you to store configuration data in key-value pairs and use them in your application's pods as environment variables or configuration files. Here's an example of how to create a ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
data:
  app-name: my-app
  log-level: debug
```

This creates a ConfigMap called `my-configmap` with two key-value pairs: `app-name` with the value `my-app`, and `log-level` with the value `debug`. You can use this ConfigMap in your application by referencing it as an environment variable or mounting it as a file.

### Secrets
Secrets are used to store sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, and other confidential information. Kubernetes encrypts and stores Secrets as base64-encoded data, and allows you to use them in your application's pods as environment variables or as files. Here's an example of how to create a Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

This creates a Secret called `my-secret` with one key-value pair: `password` with the value `cGFzc3dvcmQ=`, which is the base64-encoded value of the password password. You can use this Secret in your application by referencing it as an environment variable or mounting it as a file.

In both cases, you can reference the ConfigMap or Secret in your application's pod specification using the `env` field to set environment variables or the `volumes` field to mount files. Here's an example of how to use the ConfigMap and Secret in a pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    env:
    - name: APP_NAME
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: my-configmap
          key: app-name
    - name: LOG_LEVEL
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: my-configmap
          key: log-level
    - name: DB_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: my-secret
          key: password
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: /etc/config
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: my-configmap
```

This creates a pod with a container that references the ConfigMap and Secret as environment variables, and mounts the ConfigMap as a file. The `config-volume` volume is mounted at the path `/etc/config` in the container, and contains the files specified in the ConfigMap.

Overall, ConfigMaps and Secrets are powerful tools for managing configuration data in Kubernetes, and allow you to decouple your application's configuration from its code, making it easier to maintain and scale your applications.
