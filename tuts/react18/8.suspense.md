## Wait till something happens

Suspense is a feature in React that allows you to defer rendering of a component's content until some asynchronous task has completed, such as data fetching or image loading. It provides a way to handle loading states and errors in a more declarative and efficient way, improving the user experience of your application.

With suspense, you can specify a fallback component to render while the main component's content is being fetched. This fallback component could be a loading spinner or any other UI element that indicates that the content is still being loaded. Once the main component's content is ready, React will replace the fallback component with the main component's content.

Suspense is especially useful when dealing with complex or slow data fetching, such as fetching data from a remote API or a database. It allows you to keep your UI responsive and avoid blocking the user interface while waiting for the data to arrive.

In React 18, suspense has been extended to work with server-side rendering and server components as well, making it even more powerful and flexible.
