React 18 comes with a number of new APIs and features. Here are some of the most notable ones:

1. `useTransition` Hook: This new hook allows you to add transitions to asynchronous state updates. It takes two arguments: a function that performs the state update, and an options object that defines the duration of the transition and the delay before the transition starts.

2. `useDeferredValue` Hook: This hook allows you to defer updates to a value until a certain condition is met. This can be useful for optimizing performance by reducing the number of unnecessary updates to the UI.

3. `startTransition` Function: This function is similar to `useTransition`, but can be used outside of a React component. It takes a function that performs the state update and returns a promise that resolves when the update is complete.

4. `<React.Profiler>` Component: This new component allows you to measure the performance of a component and its children. It takes a callback function that is called when the component is mounted or updated, and provides information about the rendering time and other performance metrics.

5. `getServerSideProps` Function: This new function is part of the Next.js framework, which is commonly used with React. It allows you to fetch data from a server and pass it to a React component as props at build time, which can improve the performance of server-rendered pages.

6. Concurrent Mode: This is not a new feature, but has been improved in React 18. Concurrent Mode allows React to process multiple updates simultaneously, which can improve the perceived performance of the application. It is now easier to use with new APIs like `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue`.

7. Improved Error Handling: React 18 includes improvements to error handling, including better error messages and more consistent error boundaries.
