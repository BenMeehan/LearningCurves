Automatic batching is a powerful optimization that can significantly improve the performance of your application, especially in situations where multiple state updates are happening in quick succession. However, it's important to note that it may not always be appropriate or desirable to use automatic batching, especially if you need to ensure that certain state updates happen immediately or in a specific order. In such cases, you can use the `batchedUpdates` API to manually batch updates together.
