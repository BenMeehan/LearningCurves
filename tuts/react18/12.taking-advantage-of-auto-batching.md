In React 18, automatic batching is enabled by default, so you can take advantage of it simply by using state updates in your components. Here are some best practices for making the most of automatic batching:

1. **Batch related state updates together**: Whenever possible, try to batch state updates that are related or affect the same part of the UI. For example, if you have a component that updates both its `loading` and `data` state after fetching some data from an API, you can batch these updates together to ensure that the UI only updates once when the data is ready.

2. **Use functional updates for complex state**: When updating state that depends on its previous value, use functional updates instead of object updates. This will ensure that your updates are always based on the latest state value, even if the component is re-rendered multiple times before the state update is applied.

3. **Avoid unnecessary state updates**: To prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance, try to avoid triggering state updates that don't actually change the component's UI. For example, if you have a component that receives props from a parent component, you can use the `React.memo` higher-order component to prevent unnecessary re-renders if the props haven't changed.

4. **Use `useEffect` to batch side effects**: If your component needs to perform multiple side effects (such as fetching data from an API and updating the UI), you can use the `useEffect` hook to batch these effects together. By default, `useEffect` will run after every re-render, but you can use its dependency array to control when it runs and ensure that multiple effects are batched together.

By following these best practices, you can take advantage of automatic batching in React 18 to improve the performance of your application and reduce unnecessary re-renders.
