To use Webpack 5 with React 18, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Webpack and related dependencies: First, you need to install Webpack and related dependencies using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bashj
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

2. Install Babel and related dependencies: You also need to install Babel and related dependencies to transpile your React code to ES5. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader --save-dev
```

3. Configure Webpack: Create a webpack.config.js file in the root directory of your project and configure Webpack to transpile your React code using Babel. Here's an example configuration file:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: ['babel-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
    }),
  ],
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
  },
};
```

4. Configure Babel: Create a .babelrc file in the root directory of your project and configure Babel to transpile your React code. Here's an example configuration file:


```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

5. Create a sample React app: Create a sample React app in the src directory of your project. Here's an example App.js file:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

6. Create an index.js file: Create an index.js file in the src directory of your project that imports your React app and renders it to the DOM. Here's an example index.js file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

7. Create an HTML file: Create an index.html file in the src directory of your project that references your Webpack-generated bundle.js file. Here's an example index.html file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Webpack 5 with React 18</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

8. Start the development server: Start the development server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx webpack serve --mode development --open
```

This will start the Webpack development server and open your app in a browser window. You should see the sample React app running and the count incrementing when you click the button.
