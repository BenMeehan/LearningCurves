Webpack 5 is a major release that brings several new features and improvements. Here are some of the key changes in Webpack 5:

1. Improved performance: Webpack 5 comes with several performance optimizations that can speed up the build process and reduce the size of the output bundle. This includes better tree shaking, module federation, and caching improvements.

2. Improved caching: Webpack 5 includes a new persistent caching feature that can significantly speed up subsequent builds by reusing previously compiled assets.

3. Improved module federation: Webpack 5 introduces a new module federation feature that allows you to share code across multiple projects in real-time, without needing to build and deploy separate bundles for each project.

4. Better support for ESM: Webpack 5 now supports importing ESM modules natively, without requiring a separate loader.

5. Improved error handling: Webpack 5 includes several improvements to error reporting and handling, making it easier to diagnose and fix build errors.

6. Better support for web workers: Webpack 5 includes built-in support for web workers, allowing you to create separate worker bundles that can be loaded asynchronously.

7. Better support for assets: Webpack 5 introduces several new asset handling features, including support for asset modules, which allow you to import assets directly as module dependencies.
