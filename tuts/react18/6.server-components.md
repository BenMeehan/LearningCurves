## More components? Why?

Server components is a new feature in React 18 that allows developers to render components on the server side instead of the client side. This means that the server can handle some of the work that the client would typically do, such as rendering components and managing state.

With server components, developers can create components that are rendered on the server and streamed to the client as a fully-formed HTML response. This can improve the performance of applications by reducing the amount of work the client has to do, especially for large-scale applications with complex component trees.

Server components work by allowing developers to specify which parts of a component should be rendered on the server and which parts should be rendered on the client. This is done using a new API called `ReactDOMServer` which includes a `createComponent` function that enables developers to create server components.

One of the key benefits of server components is that they can improve the performance of applications, especially for slow or unreliable networks. By rendering components on the server, the client can receive a fully-formed HTML response more quickly, which can improve the user experience and reduce the likelihood of errors or delays.
