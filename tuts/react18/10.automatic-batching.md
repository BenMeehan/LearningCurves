## Together we change

Automatic batching is a feature in React that allows multiple state updates to be batched together into a single update. This helps to improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of times the DOM needs to be updated.

In React, when you update the state of a component, React will schedule a re-render of that component and any of its children. Normally, each state update will trigger a separate re-render, even if the updates happen in quick succession. This can lead to unnecessary DOM updates and slow down your application.

With automatic batching, React will automatically batch multiple state updates together into a single update, reducing the number of re-renders and DOM updates that need to occur. This is done by using a special mechanism to batch updates during the current event loop.

For example, let's say you have a component that updates its state multiple times in quick succession, like this:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Normally, each call to `setCount` would trigger a separate re-render. But with automatic batching, React will batch these updates together and only trigger a single re-render with the updated value of `count`.
