In Go, an interface is a collection of method signatures. An interface defines a set of behaviors that a type must implement in order to be considered an implementation of that interface.

In Go, an interface is defined using the `type` keyword, followed by the interface name, and then the method signatures in curly braces. Here is an example:

```
type Shape interface {
    area() float64
    perimeter() float64
}
```

This defines an interface `Shape` with two method signatures, `area` and `perimeter`. Any type that implements these methods can be considered a `Shape`.

To implement an interface in Go, a type must define all of the methods listed in the interface. Here is an example:

```
type Rectangle struct {
    width, height float64
}

func (r Rectangle) area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}

func (r Rectangle) perimeter() float64 {
    return 2*r.width + 2*r.height
}
```

This defines a type `Rectangle` with two methods, `area` and `perimeter`, that match the method signatures in the `Shape` interface. Therefore, a `Rectangle` value can be treated as a `Shape` value.

In Go, interfaces are used extensively to define behavior without being tied to specific implementations. This allows for a great deal of flexibility and extensibility in Go programs. For example, many of the standard library types in Go implement interfaces, which allows them to be used in a variety of different contexts.
