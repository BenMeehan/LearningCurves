Functions are a fundamental building block of Go programming. A function in Go is defined using the `func` keyword, followed by the name of the function, a list of arguments enclosed in parentheses, an optional return type, and a body enclosed in curly braces. Here is an example:

```
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

This defines a function `add` that takes two integer arguments, adds them together, and returns the result as an integer.

Functions in Go can have multiple return values, like this:

```
func divmod(a, b int) (int, int) {
    return a / b, a % b
}
```
This function takes two integer arguments and returns two integers: the quotient and remainder of dividing `a` by `b`.

Go functions can also take variable-length argument lists, using the ... syntax:

```
func sum(nums ...int) int {
    total := 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        total += num
    }
    return total
}
```

This function takes any number of integer arguments and returns their sum.

Functions in Go can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. Here is an example:

```
func multiply(a, b int) int {
    return a * b
}

func apply(f func(int, int) int, a, b int) int {
    return f(a, b)
}

func main() {
    product := apply(multiply, 2, 3)
    fmt.Println(product) // Output: 6
}
```

This defines a function `multiply` that takes two integers and returns their product, and a function `apply` that takes a function of two integers, and two integers, and returns the result of applying the function to the two integers. The `main` function calls `apply` with `multiply` and the arguments 2 and 3, which returns the product of 2 and 3, which is 6.
