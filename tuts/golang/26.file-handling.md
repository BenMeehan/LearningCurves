File handling is an important task in most programming languages, including Go. In Go, the `os` package provides functions for working with files, such as opening, creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.

Here are some examples of common file handling tasks in Go:

Creating a file:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	file, err := os.Create("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	fmt.Println("File created successfully")
}
```

In this example, we use the `os.Create()` function to create a new file named `example.txt`. The function returns a file descriptor (`*os.File`) that we can use to write data to the file. We also use the `defer` keyword to ensure that the file is closed after we're done with it.

Writing to a file:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	file, err := os.Create("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	data := []byte("Hello, world!")
	_, err = file.Write(data)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Data written successfully")
}
```

In this example, we first create a new file using `os.Create()`. We then define a byte slice containing the data we want to write to the file. We use the `file.Write()` method to write the data to the file. The method returns the number of bytes written and an error value. We use the underscore (`'_'`) *(pun intended)* to discard the number of bytes written, since we don't need it in this example.

Reading from a file:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
)

func main() {
	data, err := ioutil.ReadFile("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(string(data))
}
```

In this example, we use the `ioutil.ReadFile()` function to read the contents of the `example.txt` file into a byte slice. We then convert the byte slice to a string using the `string()` function and print it to the console.

Deleting a file:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	err := os.Remove("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("File deleted successfully")
}
```

In this example, we use the `os.Remove()` function to delete the `example.txt` file. If the file doesn't exist, the function returns an error, which we check for and handle accordingly.

These are just a few examples of the many file handling tasks you can perform in Go using the `os` package. The `os` package provides many other functions and methods for working with files, such as `os.Open()`, `os.Stat()`, `os.Chmod()`, and more.
