In Go, a map is a built-in data structure that represents a collection of key-value pairs. The keys and values in a map can be of any type, as long as they are comparable with the `==` operator.

Here is an example of a simple map that maps string keys to integer values:

```go
m := map[string]int{
    "apple":  1,
    "banana": 2,
    "orange": 3,
}
```

To access an element in a map, you can use the square bracket notation and the key of the element:

```go
value := m["banana"]
```

If the key does not exist in the map, the value returned will be the zero value for the value type of the map.

To add or update an element in a map, you can use the square bracket notation and assign a value to the key:

```go
m["grape"] = 4
```

To delete an element from a map, you can use the `delete` function and pass the key of the element:

```go
delete(m, "banana")
```
You can also use the `len` function to get the number of elements in a map:

```go
length := len(m)
```

To iterate over the elements in a map, you can use a `for` loop with the `range` keyword:

```go
for key, value := range m {
    fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```

This will print out each key-value pair in the map. Note that the order of the key-value pairs is not guaranteed.
