In Go, constants are values that cannot be changed during the execution of a program. They are often used to define values that are fixed or do not change, such as mathematical constants or program settings.

To declare a constant in Go, you can use the `const` keyword followed by the name of the constant and its value. Here is an example:

```go
const pi = 3.14159
```

This declares a constant named `pi` with the value `3.14159`. Once a constant is declared, its value cannot be changed.

Constants can also be used with data types, similar to variables. Here is an example:

```go
const (
    message string = "Hello, World!"
    count   int    = 10
)
```

This declares two constants named `message` and `count`, with the respective data types of `string` and `int`, and initializes them with the values "Hello, World!" and `10`, respectively.

Go also allows you to perform arithmetic and logical operations on constants, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing them. Here is an example:

```go
const (
    a = 10
    b = 20
)

const sum = a + b
```

This declares two constants `a` and `b` with the values `10` and `20`, respectively, and a third constant sum which is the `sum` of `a` and `b`.
