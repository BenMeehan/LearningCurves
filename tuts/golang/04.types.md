Go is a statically-typed language, which means that each variable must have a defined type at the time of compilation. The Go language provides several types of values, including:

1. Boolean values: The `bool` type represents a Boolean value, which can be either `true` or `false`.

2. Numeric values: The Go language supports several numeric types, including `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `float32`, `float64`, and `complex64`. These types represent different sizes and types of numbers, such as integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

3. Strings: The `string` type represents a sequence of characters. Strings are represented using double quotes, such as `"Hello, World!"`.

4. Arrays: An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Arrays in Go are defined using square brackets, such as `[3]int` for an array of three integers.

5. Slices: A slice is a dynamically-sized array-like data structure that can be resized during runtime. Slices are defined using square brackets with no size, such as `[]int` for a slice of integers.

6. Maps: A map is a key-value data structure, where keys and values can be of any type. Maps are defined using curly braces, such as `map[string]int` for a map of string keys and integer values.

7. Structs: A struct is a collection of named fields of different types. Structs are defined using the `struct` keyword, and their fields can be accessed using dot notation, such as `person.name` for a person struct with a `name` field.

These are some of the basic types of values that are available in Go. By using these types, you can create more complex data structures and algorithms to solve a variety of problems.
