There are several built-in functions in Go that can be used to manipulate arrays and slices. Here are some commonly used slice functions in Go:

1. `len(slice)` - returns the number of elements in the slice.

2. `cap(slice)` - returns the capacity of the slice, which is the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the underlying array without reallocation.

3. `append(slice, elements...)` - appends one or more elements to the end of the slice, and returns the resulting slice. If the capacity of the underlying array is exceeded, a new array is allocated and the elements are copied to the new array.

4. `copy(dest, src)` - copies the elements from the source slice `src` into the destination slice `dest`. The number of elements copied is the minimum of the length of the source slice and the length of the destination slice.

5. `slice[start:end]` - returns a new slice that includes the elements from `start` to end, excluding the element at index end.

In addition to these built-in functions, Go also provides a powerful set of slice manipulation functions in the `sort` package, which can be used to sort slices, search for elements in slices, and more.
