In Go, a `struct` is a composite data type that groups together zero or more values of different types under a single name. Structs are similar to classes in object-oriented programming, but with fewer features and a simpler syntax.

Here is an example of defining a struct in Go:

```go
type Person struct {
    name string
    age  int
}
```

This defines a `Person` struct with two fields: `name` of type `string` and `age` of type `int`. You can create a new `Person` value by specifying values for these fields:

```go
p := Person{name: "Alice", age: 30}
```

You can also create a `Person` value by omitting the field names and providing the values in the order they are defined in the struct:

```go
p := Person{"Alice", 30}
```

You can access the fields of a struct using the dot notation:

```go
fmt.Println(p.name) // Output: Alice
fmt.Println(p.age)  // Output: 
```

You can also create a pointer to a struct using the `&`operator:

```go
pp := &Person{name: "Bob", age: 40}
```

You can access the fields of a struct pointer using the `->` operator:

```go
fmt.Println(pp->name) // Output: Bob
fmt.Println(pp->age)  // Output: 40
```

Structs can also contain methods, which are functions that operate on values of the struct type. Here is an example of a method on the `Person` struct:

```go
func (p *Person) SayHello() {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, my name is %s and I am %d years old\n", p.name, p.age)
}
```

This method takes a pointer to a `Person` value as its receiver, and prints a greeting using the `name` and `age` fields. You can call this method on a `Person` value like this:

```go
p := Person{name: "Alice", age: 30}
p.SayHello() // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old
```
