In Go, errors are represented as values of the `error` type. The `error` type is defined as an interface with a single method called `Error() string`. This method returns a string that describes the error.

In general, Go encourages programmers to handle errors explicitly rather than using exceptions to handle errors. Go provides several mechanisms for error handling, such as returning errors as values, using panic and recover, and using the `defer` statement.

Here is an example of how to handle errors in Go:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    f, err := os.Open("test.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
        return
    }

    defer f.Close()

    // read from the file here
}
```

In this example, we open a file using the `os.Open()` function. If the file can't be opened (for example, if it doesn't exist), `os.Open()` returns an error. We check if the error is non-nil (i.e., there was an error), and if so, we print an error message and return from the function.

If the file can be opened, we use the `defer` statement to ensure that the file is closed when the function returns. This is a common pattern in Go programs: using `defer` to ensure that resources are released (such as closing files or freeing memory) when a function returns.

In general, Go programmers are encouraged to handle errors explicitly using `if` statements and to avoid using exceptions to handle errors. This approach can make code more reliable and easier to reason about, especially in large, complex programs.
