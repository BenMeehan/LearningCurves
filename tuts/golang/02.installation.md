To install Go on your computer, follow these general steps:

Go to the official Go website at https://golang.org/dl/ and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation. By default, Go will be installed to the `/usr/local/go` directory on Unix-based systems and to `C:\Go` on Windows.

After installation, you need to set up the environment variables to use the Go executable. You need to add the Go binary directory to the PATH environment variable. This can be done by adding the following line to your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc` on Linux or `~/.bash_profile` on macOS):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin  # for Unix-based systems
```
or

```bash
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Go\bin  # for Windows
```

Verify that Go is installed correctly by opening a command prompt or terminal window and typing the following command:

```bash
go version
```

This should output the version of Go that you installed.

That's it! You should now have Go installed on your computer and be ready to start coding.
