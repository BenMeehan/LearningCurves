In Go, the `range` keyword is used to iterate over elements in a variety of data structures, including arrays, slices, maps, and channels.

When used with an array or slice, the `range` keyword returns two values on each iteration: the index of the element and the value of the element. Here is an example:

```go
s := []string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for index, value := range s {
    fmt.Println(index, value)
}
```

This will output:

```bash
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
```

When used with a map, the `range` keyword returns two values on each iteration: the key of the element and the value of the element. Here is an example:

```go
m := map[string]int{
    "apple":  1,
    "banana": 2,
    "cherry": 3,
}

for key, value := range m {
    fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```

This will output:

```bash
apple 1
banana 2
cherry 3
```

(see channels section first)
When used with a channel, the `range` keyword iterates over the values sent on the channel until the channel is closed. Here is an example:

```go
c := make(chan int)

go func() {
    c <- 1
    c <- 2
    c <- 3
    close(c)
}()

for value := range c {
    fmt.Println(value)
}
```

This will output:

```bash
1
2
3
```

Note that when used with a channel, the `range` keyword will block until a value is sent on the channel. If the channel is closed, the loop will exit.
