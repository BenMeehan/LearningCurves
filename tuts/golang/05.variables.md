In Go, you can declare and initialize variables using the `var` keyword followed by the variable name and the type of the variable. Here is an example:

```
var x int = 10
```

This declares a variable named `x` of type `int` and initializes it with the value `10`.

You can also use the shorter `:=` syntax to declare and initialize a variable in a single line without specifying the type. Here is an example:

```
y := "Hello, World!"
```

This declares a variable named `y` and initializes it with the string value "Hello, World!". The type of the variable is inferred from the value that is assigned to it.

Go also supports multiple variable declarations and assignments in a single line. Here is an example:

```
var a, b, c int = 1, 2, 3
```

This declares three variables named `a`, `b`, and `c` of type `int` and initializes them with the values `1`,`2`, and `3`respectively.

You can also declare and initialize variables using the zero value of their respective types, which is the default value that is assigned if no other value is specified. Here is an example:

```
var d bool   // zero value is false
var e int    // zero value is 0
var f string // zero value is ""
```

These are some of the basic ways to declare and initialize variables in Go. Once a variable is declared and initialized, it can be used in expressions and statements to perform calculations and operations.
