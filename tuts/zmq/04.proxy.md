In ZeroMQ (ZMQ), a proxy is a device that sits between two or more sockets and forwards messages between them. The proxy can be used to distribute work among a set of workers, or to create a bridge between different network topologies.

In Python, you can create a ZMQ proxy using the `zmq.devices` module. The `zmq.devices` module provides a set of pre-built proxy devices that can be used to forward messages between sockets of different types. Here's an example of using the `zmq.devices` module to create a proxy that forwards messages between two `tcp` sockets:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()

# Create frontend and backend sockets
frontend = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
frontend.bind("tcp://*:5555")
frontend.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, b"")  # subscribe to all messages

backend = context.socket(zmq.PUB)
backend.bind("tcp://*:5556")

# Create and start the proxy
zmq.device(zmq.FORWARDER, frontend, backend)

# Cleanup
frontend.close()
backend.close()
context.term()
```

In this example, we create two sockets: a `SUB` socket named `frontend` that binds to the `tcp://*:5555` endpoint and subscribes to all messages, and a `PUB` socket named `backend` that binds to the `tcp://*:5556` endpoint.

We then create a proxy using the `zmq.device()` function, specifying the `zmq.FORWARDER` proxy type, and passing in the `frontend` and `backend` sockets. The `zmq.device()` function will start the proxy and forward messages between the sockets.

Finally, we close the sockets and terminate the ZeroMQ context using the `close()` and `term()` methods, respectively.

Note that you can also create a custom proxy by manually forwarding messages between sockets using a loop. This approach can be more flexible than using the pre-built proxy devices, but it requires more code to implement.
