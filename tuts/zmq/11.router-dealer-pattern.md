In ZeroMQ (ZMQ), the router-dealer pattern is a messaging pattern that enables multiple clients to connect to a single server or broker and exchange messages in a two-way asynchronous manner. This pattern is useful for building distributed systems that require a reliable message exchange between clients and servers.

The router-dealer pattern consists of two types of sockets: a ROUTER socket and a DEALER socket. The ROUTER socket acts as a server or broker that receives messages from multiple DEALER sockets and routes them to the correct DEALER socket. The DEALER socket acts as a client that sends and receives messages to and from the ROUTER socket.

Here's an example of using ZeroMQ to implement the router-dealer pattern in Python:

Server:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
router = context.socket(zmq.ROUTER)
router.bind("tcp://*:5555")

while True:
    identity, message = router.recv_multipart()
    print("Received message: %s from %s" % (message, identity))
    router.send_multipart([identity, b"ACK"])
```

Client A:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
dealer = context.socket(zmq.DEALER)
dealer.setsockopt(zmq.IDENTITY, b"A")
dealer.connect("tcp://localhost:5555")

dealer.send(b"Hello from A")
print(dealer.recv())
```

Client B:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
dealer = context.socket(zmq.DEALER)
dealer.setsockopt(zmq.IDENTITY, b"B")
dealer.connect("tcp://localhost:5555")

dealer.send(b"Hello from B")
print(dealer.recv())
```

In this example, the server creates a `ROUTER` socket and binds it to the `tcp://*:5555` endpoint. It receives messages from multiple `DEALER` sockets using the `router.recv_multipart()` method and prints the received message and the sender's identity to the console. It sends an acknowledgement message "ACK" back to the `DEALER` socket using the `router.send_multipart()` method.

Client A and Client B create `DEALER` sockets and connect to the `tcp://localhost:5555` endpoint. They send a message "Hello from A" and "Hello from B", respectively, using the `dealer.send()` method, and wait for an acknowledgement message from the server using the `dealer.recv()` method. The `setsockopt(zmq.IDENTITY, b"A")` and `setsockopt(zmq.IDENTITY, b"B")` calls set the identities of the `DEALER` sockets to "A" and "B", respectively.

*Note that the router-dealer pattern allows for asynchronous communication between the clients and server. The server can handle messages from multiple clients concurrently, and the clients can send and receive messages independently.*
