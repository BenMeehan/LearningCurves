The pipeline pattern is a messaging pattern in ZeroMQ (ZMQ) that uses a series of intermediary nodes to transport messages from a set of senders to a set of receivers. This pattern is useful for building complex systems where multiple processes or threads need to exchange data in a pipeline fashion.

In the pipeline pattern, there are two types of nodes: workers and brokers. Workers are processes that perform some kind of computation on incoming messages and produce output messages. Brokers are intermediary nodes that route messages from workers to other workers or to the final destination.

Here's an example of using ZeroMQ to implement the pipeline pattern in Python:

Worker A:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
receiver = context.socket(zmq.PULL)
receiver.connect("tcp://localhost:5557")

sender = context.socket(zmq.PUSH)
sender.connect("tcp://localhost:5558")

while True:
    message = receiver.recv_string()
    result = message.upper()
    sender.send_string(result)
```

Worker B:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
receiver = context.socket(zmq.PULL)
receiver.connect("tcp://localhost:5558")

sender = context.socket(zmq.PUSH)
sender.connect("tcp://localhost:5559")

while True:
    message = receiver.recv_string()
    result = message.lower()
    sender.send_string(result)
```

Client:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
sender = context.socket(zmq.PUSH)
sender.bind("tcp://*:5557")

receiver = context.socket(zmq.PULL)
receiver.bind("tcp://*:5559")

for i in range(10):
    message = "Message %s" % i
    sender.send_string(message)
    result = receiver.recv_string()
    print("Received result: %s" % result)
```

In this example, Worker A and Worker B create `PULL` sockets and connect to the `tcp://localhost:5557` and `tcp://localhost:5558` endpoints, respectively. They also create PUSH sockets and connect to the `tcp://localhost:5558 `and `tcp://localhost:5559` endpoints, respectively. Worker A receives a message from Worker B using the `receiver.recv_string()` method, converts the message to uppercase, and sends it to Worker B using the `sender.send_string()` method. Worker B receives a message from Worker A, converts it to lowercase, and sends it to the final destination using the `sender.send_string()` method.

The client creates `PUSH` and `PULL` sockets and binds to the `tcp://*:5557` and `tcp://*:5559` endpoints, respectively. It sends ten messages to Worker A using the `sender.send_string()` method and receives the results from Worker B using the `receiver.recv_string()` method.

*Note that in the pipeline pattern, the workers and brokers are decoupled, meaning that they can operate at different rates and be implemented in different languages or environments.*
