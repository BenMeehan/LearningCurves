ZeroMQ (ZMQ) supports a range of messaging patterns, including request-reply, which is a synchronous messaging pattern where a client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with a reply message. Here's an example of using ZeroMQ to implement the request-reply pattern in Python:

Server:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.REP)
socket.bind("tcp://*:5555")

while True:
    message = socket.recv_string()
    print("Received request: %s" % message)
    response = "Hello, %s!" % message
    socket.send_string(response)
```

Client:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.REQ)
socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5555")

while True:
    message = input("Enter your name: ")
    socket.send_string(message)
    response = socket.recv_string()
    print("Received response: %s" % response)
```

In this example, the server creates a `REP` socket and binds to the `tcp://*:5555` endpoint. The server then waits for a request message using the `socket.recv_string()` method, prints the received message to the console, generates a response message by appending "Hello, " to the received message, and sends the response using the `socket.send_string()` method.

The client creates a `REQ` socket and connects to the `tcp://localhost:5555` endpoint. The client then enters a name using the `input()` function, sends a request message containing the name using the `socket.send_string()` method, receives the response message using the `socket.recv_string()` method, and prints the response message to the console.

Note that the request-reply pattern in ZeroMQ is synchronous, meaning the client will block until a response is received. If you need to implement an asynchronous request-reply pattern, you can use the ZeroMQ `zmq_poll()` function or a multi-threaded or multi-process architecture.
