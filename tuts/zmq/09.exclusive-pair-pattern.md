In ZeroMQ (ZMQ), the exclusive pair pattern is a messaging pattern that creates a two-way communication channel between two sockets. The sockets in an exclusive pair can communicate only with each other and cannot connect to any other sockets. This pattern is useful for building low-latency, high-throughput messaging systems where two processes need to communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion.

Here's an example of using ZeroMQ to implement the exclusive pair pattern in Python:

Socket A:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.PAIR)
socket.bind("tcp://*:5555")

while True:
    message = socket.recv_string()
    print("Received message: %s" % message)
    socket.send_string("ACK")
```

Socket B:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.PAIR)
socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5555")

while True:
    socket.send_string("Hello")
    message = socket.recv_string()
    print("Received message: %s" % message)
```

In this example, Socket A creates a `PAIR` socket and binds to the `tcp://*:5555` endpoint. It waits for a message from Socket B using the `socket.recv_string()` method, prints the received message to the console, and sends an acknowledgement message "ACK" back to Socket B using the `socket.send_string()` method.

Socket B creates a `PAIR` socket and connects to the `tcp://localhost:5555` endpoint. It sends a message "Hello" to Socket A using the `socket.send_string()` method, waits for an acknowledgement message from Socket A using the `socket.recv_string()`method, prints the received message to the console.

Note that in the exclusive pair pattern, each socket can only connect to one other socket. If you need to connect more than two sockets, you should consider using another pattern such as the publish-subscribe pattern or the push-pull pattern.
