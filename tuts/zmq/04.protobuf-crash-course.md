Protocol Buffers (protobuf) is a language-agnostic data serialization format developed by Google that is used to serialize and transmit structured data. Protocol Buffers are used extensively in distributed systems, such as in communication between microservices or between a client and server.

To use Protocol Buffers in Python, you need to install the protobuf compiler and the protobuf Python module. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install protobuf
```

After installing the protobuf module, you need to define your message schema using a .proto file. Here is an example of a .proto file:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package my_package;

message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
  repeated string email = 3;
}
```

This schema defines a `Person` message with three fields: `name`, `age`, and `email`. The `name` field is a string, the `age` field is an integer, and the `email` field is a repeated string.

To generate Python code from the .proto file, you need to compile it using the protobuf compiler. Run the following command in the directory where your .proto file is located:

```bash
protoc --python_out=. your_proto_file.proto
```

This generates a Python module named `your_proto_file_pb2.py` in the current directory. This module contains the Python classes that correspond to the messages defined in the .proto file.

Here's an example of how to use Protocol Buffers in Python:

```python
import my_package_pb2

# create a new Person message
person = my_package_pb2.Person()
person.name = "John"
person.age = 30
person.email.append("john@example.com")
person.email.append("john@gmail.com")

# serialize the message to a byte string
person_data = person.SerializeToString()

# deserialize the message from the byte string
new_person = my_package_pb2.Person()
new_person.ParseFromString(person_data)

# access the fields of the deserialized message
print(new_person.name)    # prints "John"
print(new_person.age)     # prints 30
print(new_person.email)   # prints ["john@example.com", "john@gmail.com"]
```

In this example, we first import the Python module generated from the .proto file. We then create a new `Person` message and set its fields using the generated Python class. We serialize the message to a byte string using the `SerializeToString()` method, and deserialize it from the byte string using the `ParseFromString()` method. We can then access the fields of the deserialized message using the generated Python class.

This is just a basic example of how to use Protocol Buffers in Python. There are many more advanced features available in Protocol Buffers, such as custom options, nested messages, and more.
