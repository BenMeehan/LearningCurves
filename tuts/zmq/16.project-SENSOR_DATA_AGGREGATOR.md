Sensor data aggregation using ZMQ can be used to collect data from multiple sensors distributed across a network and transmit the data to a centralized location for further processing. Here's a high-level overview of how this can be achieved using ZMQ:

1. Each sensor is connected to a ZMQ socket running a PUB/SUB pattern. The sensor publishes data to the socket on a specific topic, such as the type of sensor or its location.

2. A centralized aggregator is connected to the PUB sockets of each sensor. The aggregator uses a ZMQ socket running a SUB/PUB pattern to subscribe to the specific topics it is interested in and publish the aggregated data to a new topic.

3. The aggregator can perform various operations on the data, such as filtering or averaging. The specific operations will depend on the requirements of the application.

4. The aggregated data is then published to a new topic on the aggregator's PUB socket. This data can be consumed by downstream applications or stored for later analysis.

Here's an example of how the architecture might look like in Python:

Setting up the publisher on each sensor:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.PUB)
socket.connect("tcp://aggregator:5555")
sensor_data = {
    "temperature": 30.0,
    "humidity": 50.0,
    "pressure": 1013.25
}
socket.send_json(sensor_data, zmq.NOBLOCK)
```

Setting up the aggregator to subscribe to the specific topics and publish the aggregated data:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
subscriber = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
subscriber.connect("tcp://sensor1:5555")
subscriber.connect("tcp://sensor2:5555")
subscriber.connect("tcp://sensor3:5555")
subscriber.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, b"temperature")
subscriber.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, b"humidity")
subscriber.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, b"pressure")

publisher = context.socket(zmq.PUB)
publisher.bind("tcp://*:5555")

while True:
    topic, data = subscriber.recv_multipart()
    # aggregate the data here
    aggregated_data = {
        "mean_temperature": ...,
        "mean_humidity": ...,
        "mean_pressure": ...
    }
    publisher.send_json(aggregated_data)
```

This is just a high-level overview of how sensor data aggregation can be achieved using ZMQ. The exact implementation details will depend on the specific requirements of your application and the architecture you choose.
