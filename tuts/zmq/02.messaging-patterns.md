ZeroMQ (ZMQ) supports various messaging patterns, each of which is suited to different types of communication between applications. Here are some of the common messaging patterns supported by ZMQ:

1. Request/Reply Pattern: In this pattern, a client sends a request message to a server and waits for a reply. The server processes the request and sends a reply message back to the client. This pattern is commonly used in client-server architectures.

2. Publish/Subscribe Pattern: In this pattern, there are one or more publishers that send messages to one or more subscribers. Publishers do not know who the subscribers are, and subscribers do not know who the publishers are. This pattern is useful for broadcasting data to multiple subscribers.

3. Push/Pull Pattern: In this pattern, there are one or more pushers that send messages to one or more pullers. Pushers do not know who the pullers are, and pullers do not know who the pushers are. This pattern is useful for load balancing work among multiple workers.

4. Exclusive Pair Pattern: In this pattern, there are exactly two sockets connected together. Only one socket can send messages at a time, and the other socket can only receive messages. This pattern is useful for building a simple, bi-directional communication channel.

5. Pipeline Pattern: In this pattern, there are multiple stages of workers connected in a chain. Each worker receives a message from the previous worker, processes it, and sends it to the next worker in the chain. This pattern is useful for processing large volumes of data in a distributed and parallel way.

6. Router/Dealer Pattern: In this pattern, there is a router socket that sends messages to multiple dealer sockets, and dealer sockets that receive messages from the router. This pattern is useful for building a multi-tenant messaging system where different clients receive different types of messages.

These are some of the messaging patterns supported by ZMQ. Each pattern has its own strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right pattern depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application.
