ZeroMQ (ZMQ) is a high-performance messaging library that provides a range of communication patterns, including publish-subscribe. Publish-subscribe is a messaging pattern that involves one-to-many distribution of messages, where a publisher sends messages to a set of subscribers. The subscribers receive the messages without the publisher having to know the subscribers' identities.

In ZeroMQ, the publish-subscribe pattern is implemented using two socket types: PUB and SUB. The publisher socket (PUB) sends messages to all subscribers that have connected to it, while the subscriber socket (SUB) receives messages from one or more publishers.

Here's a basic example of the publish-subscribe pattern in ZeroMQ:

Publisher:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.PUB)
socket.bind("tcp://*:5555")

while True:
    message = input("Enter message to publish: ")
    socket.send_string(message)
```

Subscriber:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5555")
socket.subscribe("")

while True:
    message = socket.recv_string()
    print("Received message: %s" % message)
```

In this example, the publisher socket binds to the `tcp://*:5555` endpoint and sends messages using the `socket.send_string() `method. The subscriber socket connects to the `tcp://localhost:5555` endpoint and sets the subscription filter to an empty string using the `socket.subscribe("")` method, meaning it will receive all messages. The subscriber then receives messages using the `socket.recv_string()` method and prints them to the console.

*Note that the `socket.subscribe()` method can also be used to filter messages based on a specific prefix, such as `socket.subscribe("weather.")` to receive only messages related to weather data.*`
