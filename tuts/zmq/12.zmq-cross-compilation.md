To cross-compile a Python program that uses ZMQ, you need to first install the cross-compiler toolchain for the target architecture. You also need to install a Python interpreter that is compatible with the target architecture.

Once you have the cross-compiler toolchain and Python interpreter installed, you can use the `pip` package manager to install the `pyzmq` package for the target architecture. You can then use a Python build tool such as `pyinstaller` to create a standalone executable that includes the `pyzmq` package and any other dependencies.

Here's an example of how to cross-compile a Python program that uses ZMQ on Linux for ARM architecture:

1. Install the cross-compiler toolchain for ARM:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

2. Download and install the Python interpreter for ARM:
```bash
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.11/Python-3.8.11.tgz
tar -xvf Python-3.8.11.tgz
cd Python-3.8.11
./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf --prefix=/usr/local/arm-python
make
sudo make install
```

3. Install the `pyzmq` package for ARM:
```bash
/usr/local/arm-python/bin/pip install pyzmq
```
4. Use `pyinstaller` to create a standalone executable:
```python
/usr/local/arm-python/bin/pyinstaller --onefile my_program.py
```

This creates a standalone executable in the `dist` directory that includes the `pyzmq` package and any other dependencies.

Note that the exact steps may vary depending on your target architecture and operating system. Also, cross-compiling a Python program with ZMQ can be a complex and error-prone process, so it's important to thoroughly test the executable on the target architecture to ensure it works as expected.
