ZeroMQ (ZMQ) supports a range of messaging patterns, including push-pull, which is a asynchronous messaging pattern where a set of push sockets send messages to a set of pull sockets. Here's an example of using ZeroMQ to implement the push-pull pattern in Python:

Pusher:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.PUSH)
socket.bind("tcp://*:5555")

for i in range(10):
    message = "message %s" % i
    socket.send_string(message)
    print("Sent message: %s" % message)
```

Puller:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.PULL)
socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5555")

while True:
    message = socket.recv_string()
    print("Received message: %s" % message)
```
In this example, the pusher creates a `PUSH` socket and binds to the `tcp://*:5555`endpoint. The pusher then sends ten messages using the `socket.send_string()` method, each containing the string "message" followed by the message number.

The puller creates a `PULL` socket and connects to the `tcp://localhost:5555` endpoint. The puller then waits for messages using the `socket.recv_string()` method and prints the received messages to the console.

Note that in the push-pull pattern, messages are sent asynchronously, meaning the pusher and puller can operate at different rates. If there are more pushers than pullers, messages will be distributed among the pullers in a round-robin fashion. If there are more pullers than pushers, some pullers may not receive any messages. If you need to ensure that every message is received by every puller, you can use the publish-subscribe pattern or another appropriate pattern.
