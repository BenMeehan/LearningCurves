A distributed game server using ZMQ can be designed as follows:

1. The game server is split into multiple components, each running on a separate machine or node in a cluster.

2. Each component is responsible for managing a subset of the game state, such as player data, game world data, or chat data.

3. The components communicate with each other using ZMQ sockets, using a PUB/SUB or ROUTER/DEALER pattern.

4. The central game server component manages the overall game state and coordinates communication between the different components.

5. When a player logs in, they are assigned to a specific component based on load balancing rules, such as the current number of players on each component.

6. The player's actions are transmitted to the component managing their game state, which updates the game state accordingly and communicates the changes to the other components.

7. The central game server component also manages player authentication and communication with external services, such as a database or authentication server.

Here's a brief example of how the architecture might look like in Python:

Each component creates a ZMQ context and a PUB socket, which is used to broadcast changes to the game state:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.PUB)
socket.bind("tcp://*:5555")
```

The central game server component creates a ZMQ context and a ROUTER socket, which is used to route messages between the different components:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.ROUTER)
socket.bind("tcp://*:5556")
```

When a player logs in, the central game server component assigns them to a specific component based on load balancing rules and sends a message to the appropriate PUB socket:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.REQ)
socket.connect("tcp://game-component-1:5555")
socket.send(b"Player 12345 has logged in")
message = socket.recv()
```

The component managing the player's game state receives the message and updates the game state accordingly:

```python
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
socket.connect("tcp://central-server:5556")
socket.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, b"Player 12345")
while True:
    message = socket.recv()
    # Update game state for player 12345 based on the message
```

This is just a high-level overview of how a distributed game server using ZMQ might work. The exact implementation details will depend on the specific requirements of your game and the architecture you choose.
