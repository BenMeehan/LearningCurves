In Go, the `for` loop is a language construct used to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times, or while a certain condition is true. The basic syntax of a `for` loop in Go is:

```
for initialization; condition; post {
    // Code to be repeated
}
```

Here's what each of the parts of the `for` loop mean:

- `initialization` is a statement that is executed before the first iteration of the loop. It usually declares or initializes variables that will be used in the loop.
- `condition` is an expression that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is `true`, the loop continues. If it's `false`, the loop terminates.
- `post` is a statement that is executed at the end of each iteration of the loop. It's usually used to update the loop counter or perform some other action.

Here's an example of a `for` loop that prints the numbers 0 through 4:

```
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}

```
In this example, `i` is initialized to `0`, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `5`. The `fmt.Println(i)` statement is executed at the end of each iteration of the loop, printing the current value of `i`. Finally, `i` is incremented by `1` using the `i++` statement.

You can also use the `for` loop without any initialization or post statements to create a loop that runs indefinitely. Here's an example:

```
for {
    // Code to be repeated
}
```

This is equivalent to a `while` loop in other languages. The loop continues as long as the condition in the code block is true, or until a `break` or `return` statement is encountered.
