A shell, or command-line interface, is a powerful tool used by developers and system administrators to interact with a computer's operating system. In Golang, we can create a simple shell clone using the `os/exec` package.

Here's an example of a simple shell clone that takes user input, runs the specified command, and prints the output:

```
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "os/exec"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)

    for {
        fmt.Print("$ ")

        if !scanner.Scan() {
            return
        }

        line := scanner.Text()

        if len(line) == 0 {
            continue
        }

        args := strings.Split(line, " ")

        cmd := exec.Command(args[0], args[1:]...)
        output, err := cmd.Output()

        if err != nil {
            fmt.Printf("Error running command: %s\n", err)
        } else {
            fmt.Printf("%s", output)
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a `bufio.Scanner` to read user input from `os.Stdin`. We then enter a loop where we prompt the user for input with `$`, and read the input using the `scanner.Scan()` method.

If the user enters an empty line, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, we split the input line into separate command and argument strings using `strings.Split()`. We then create a new `exec.Command` with the command and arguments and execute it using the `cmd.Output()` method.

If the command runs successfully, we print the output to the console. If an error occurs, we print an error message.

This is just a simple example of how to create a shell clone in Golang. With a few modifications, you can add support for piping, redirection, and other advanced features commonly found in modern shells.
