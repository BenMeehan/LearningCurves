In Go, a method is a function that is associated with a particular type. Methods are defined using the `func` keyword, followed by the receiver type in parentheses, and then the method name, argument list, return type, and body in curly braces. Here is an example:

```
type Rectangle struct {
    width, height float64
}

func (r Rectangle) area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}
```

This defines a type `Rectangle` with two fields, `width` and `height`, and a method `area` that returns the area of the rectangle. The receiver type for the `area` method is `Rectangle`, which means that it can be called on any value of that type.

Methods in Go can also have pointer receivers, which allow them to modify the value they are called on. Here is an example:

```
type Rectangle struct {
    width, height float64
}

func (r *Rectangle) setWidth(w float64) {
    r.width = w
}
```

This defines a method `setWidth` on the `Rectangle` type, with a pointer receiver. This method allows the width of the rectangle to be set to a new value.

Methods can be defined on any user-defined type in Go, including struct types, interface types, and even basic types like integers and strings. Here is an example:

```
type MyInt int

func (i MyInt) isEven() bool {
    return i%2 == 0
}
```

This defines a new type `MyInt` based on the `int` type, and a method `isEven` that returns true if the integer is even.

Methods in Go are a powerful way to add behavior to user-defined types, and can be used to implement object-oriented programming patterns in Go.
