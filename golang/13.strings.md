In Go, strings are a built-in data type that represent a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed.

Here are some basic operations that can be performed on strings in Go:

1. Creating a string:

```
s := "hello"
```

2. Concatenating two strings:

```
s := "hello"
t := "world"
u := s + " " + t // u is now "hello world"
```

3. Finding the length of a string:

```
s := "hello"
length := len(s) // length is now 5
```

4. Accessing a character in a string by index:

```
s := "hello"
c := s[1] // c is now 'e'
```

Note that strings in Go are represented as a sequence of bytes, so accessing a character in a string returns its corresponding byte value. To get the actual character, you can use the `string` type conversion:

```
s := "hello"
c := string(s[1]) // c is now "e"
```

5. Comparing two strings:

```
s := "hello"
t := "world"
if s == t {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
```

6. Searching for a substring within a string:

```
s := "hello world"
if strings.Contains(s, "world") {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
```

Note that the strings package provides many other string manipulation functions that can be useful, such as `strings.Split`, `strings.Join`, `strings.Replace`, and more.
