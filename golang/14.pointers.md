In Go, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used to allow functions and methods to modify the values of variables that are passed to them as arguments.

Here is an example of declaring a pointer in Go:

```
var p *int
```

This declares a variable `p` that is a pointer to an integer. To assign a value to `p`, you need to use the `&` operator to take the address of an existing integer variable:

```
var x int = 42
p = &x
```

This assigns the address of `x` to `p`. You can then use the `*` operator to access the value that `p` points to:

```
fmt.Println(*p) // Output: 42
```

This prints the value of `x`, which is the value that `p` points to.

You can also create a new variable on the heap using the `new` function, which returns a pointer to the new variable:

```
p := new(int)
*p = 42
fmt.Println(*p) // Output: 42
```

This creates a new integer variable on the heap, assigns the value 42 to it, and returns a pointer to it. You can then use the `*` operator to access the value of the new variable.

When passing a pointer to a function, you can use the same syntax as when declaring a pointer variable:

```
func increment(p *int) {
    *p++
}

var x int = 42
increment(&x)
fmt.Println(x) // Output: 43
```

This defines a function `increment` that takes a pointer to an integer as its argument, and increments the value that the pointer points to. You can then call the function with a pointer to `x` using the `&` operator. After the function returns, the value of `x` has been incremented to `43`.
