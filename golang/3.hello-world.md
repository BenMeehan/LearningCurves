Here is an example of a "Hello, World!" program in Go:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

This program consists of a single file that defines a `main` function, which is the entry point for the program. The `fmt` package is imported to enable printing to the console. The `main` function simply prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console using the `fmt.Println` function.

To run this program, you can save the code to a file with a `.go` extension (e.g. `helloworld.go`), and then use the Go compiler to build and run the program. Here is an example of how to do this on the command line:

```
$ go build helloworld.go  # Compile the program
$ ./helloworld           # Run the program
Hello, World!
```

This program should output the string "Hello, World!" to the console when executed.
